        Calculates the cyclomatic complexity of each non-abstract method. Cyclomatic complexity
        is a measure of the number of distinct execution paths through each method.
        This can also be considered as the minimal number of tests necessary to completely exercise a method's control flow.
        In practice, this is 1 + the number of if's, while's, for's, do's, switch cases, catches,
        conditional expressions, &&'s and ||'s in the method.
